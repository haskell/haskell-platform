Haskell Platform
http://www.haskell.org/platform/
================================

This is the source tarball for Haskell Platform. It contains the source and
build files for all the packages that make up the platform, beyond those that
come with GHC.

If your OS has a pre-built distribution of Haskell Platform, that is likely to
be a much easier way than building the platform yourself. The Haskell Platform
web site (see above URL) contains builds for Mac OS X and Windows that include
everything you need, including GHC.

The web site also contains links for those Linux distributions for which there
is a pre-build version. In most cases, that version of the platform is available
through the normal package manager for the distribution, rather than directly
from the Haskell Platform web site.


Preparation
-----------

You will need to have GHC 7.4.2 installed prior to building the platform.
Please see:
    http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_4_2

Note that the warning at top will tell you to consider installing the
platform instead. If you've gotten this far, you can ignore that.

You can use a different version of GHC, but it may not work.

You will also need the developer packages for various standard system libraries,
such as zlib and GLUT. Exactly which packages you need will differ based on
the OS distribution you use. In general, if you get an error during the build
process that a library is missing, look it up in your package manager. You will
need both the library and the development package for the library.


Build and Install
-----------------

In this directory, run:

    ./configure

This is standard autoconf, so options like --prefix will work. Run with --help
to see all the options. In particular, if you are using a different version of
GHC, you'll need to add --enable-unsupported-ghc-version.

Now build the packages:

    make

Finally, to install everything, use

    make install

Note that you will probably have to run this command with 'sudo'.
