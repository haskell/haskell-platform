To build the Haskell Platform for Mac OS X:

1) Edit the makefile so that GHC_ARCH is set to the architecture you're building

2) Be sure you have hscolour installed on your system, and on your path.

3) Edit ../generic/tarball/scripts/build.sh and un-comment out the flag
    HADDOCK_FLAG="--hyperlink-source"

4a) If you have the proper GHC installer package:
    create a subdirectory "dist-i386" or "dist-x86_64 here
    move or sym-link the package into it
You should have a file there named something like
    GHC-7.6.3-i386.pkg
    GHC-7.6.3-x86_64.pkg
Run
    make unpack-ghc

4b) If you have a bindist of GHC
    get the source tar ball too (!) and unpack it somewhere
    cd into distrib/MacOS
    Run:
        ./mkinstaller xxxx/ghc-7.6.3-<arch>-apple-darwin.tar.bz2
    This will take a long time and fail before compleating -- s'okay!
    Run:
        rm -rf dist-<arch>/root
        mkdir -p dist-<arch>/root/Library
        mkdir -p dist-<arch>/GHC-Package/ghc.pkg/Scripts
        mv  /tmp/GHC.dst/Library/Frameworks dist-<arch>/root/Library
        cp <src>/distrib/MacOS/installer-scripts/create-links  dist-<arch>/GHC-Package/ghc.pkg/Scripts

5) There is no step 5!

6) Edit the ghc settings file in:
    dist/root/Library/Frameworks/GHC.framework/Versions/7.4.1-i386/usr/lib/ghc-7.4.1

Make sure that the entries for "C compiler command" and "ar command" are:
 ("C compiler command", "/usr/bin/gcc"),
 ("ar command", "/usr/bin/ar"),

7) Update your cabal package list:
    cabal update

8) Run
    make rewrap
    make source

Note: If this fails, you may have to fiddle with things in ../src/generic to
get Build.hs to build. This can be done with your already installed Haskell
system. If things fail during this step, you'll probably have to remove
../src/generic/haskell-platform-* to get them to run again.

9)
    make config
    make build
    make package
    make scripts
    make doc
    make polish

10) Build the final installer:
    make installer

This will ask you for your password so it can sudo the tree to root. Then it
will launch PackageMaker. Now click Build... and choose a suitable name and
location for the result.

11) Go have some tea.
