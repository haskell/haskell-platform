What's new in 2009.2.0.1-rc2:

    * Version number is now 2009.2.0.1.

    * The default install directory change was reverted.

--

What's new in 2009.2.1-rc1:

    * The platform installer is now relocatable (all libraries are installed
      into a single directory, and referred to via '$topdir' in package.conf).

    * The default install directory no longer contains spaces (it was changed to
      $SYSTEMDRIVE\HaskellPlatform\$PLATFORM_VERSION).

Known issues:

    * The network and time libraries shipped with GHC 6.10.3 were replaced with
      versions specified in the 'haskell-platform.cabal' file (2.2.1.1 and
      1.1.2.4 instead of 2.2.1 and 1.1.3, respectively).

    * The issue of upgrading wasn't given much thought, so you're advised to
      delete the previous Haskell Platform installation before using this
      installer. OTOH, our behaviour is no worse than that of the existing GHC
      installer.

    * The installer may work with restricted user accounts, but it has not been
      tested and is not officially supported. The "just unpack" option should
      work, however, since it doesn't do anything fancy.

    * glut32.dll is not included, though it probably should be.

--

What's new in 2009.2.0-rc1:

    * We now use a single root directory for both GHC and extralibs
      ($PROGRAMFILES\Haskell Platform\$HP_VERSION).

    * Installed files are tracked precisely (no unsafe `rm -rf` business).

    * A new installation mode which doesn't touch the system settings or
      registry was introduced. Suggested by Claus Reinke.

    * Installer size was cut down by 50% by turning on 7z compression (thanks to
      Bulat Ziganshin for the heads-up).

    * The welcome screen is now slightly less dull.

Known issues:

    * The installer may work with restricted user accounts, but it has not been
      tested and is not officially supported. The "minimal install" option (just
      unpack the files) will most probably work, however, since it doesn't do
      anything fancy.

    * glut32.dll is not included, though it probably should be.
