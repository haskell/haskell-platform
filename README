Haskell Platform
----------------

NOTE: Mar. 2014 - We are in the middle of transitioning to a wholly new build
system for the platform. This README gives preliminary notes on how to use it,
but expect a bumpy ride!


BUILDING
--------
The platform is now built by a program called hptool, included in this repo.
That tool is a shake based build system that creates both the traditional
haskell-platform source tarball, and can build a complete, hermetic build of
the platform for use in building OS installer packages.

To boot-strap the build, the current system must have a working GHC installed,
and cabal with sandbox support installed (generally 1.18.0 or later)[1], and an
HsColour executable must be in your PATH (current recommended version is
1.20.3). You also need a GHC bindist tarball that matches the platform[2].

Then simply, run this:

   ./platform.sh $PATH_TO_GHC_BINDIST_TARBALL

This will build the hptool itself, and then use that tool to build first the
platform source tarball, and finally the hermetic build of all the platform
packages.[3]


[1] You can fiddle with ./platform.sh and remove the need for the sandbox if
you really want to build with an earlier cabal.

[2] Currently, the version of GHC isn't really checked, so any close bindist
should work. In particular, the RC2 for 7.8 works.

[3] This build is currently incomplete. In particular it doesn't include
haddock, has a fixed layout as used on OS X, and doesn't have any of the
supporting scripts needed at installation time.

WORK IN PROGRESS
----------------
This is currently a work in progress. See notes/BUILD-NEW for lots of thoughts,
notes, and to dos for the new build.

If you are a packager for an OS, then adding details for what needs to get done
to "prep" the target image for the OS would be great. As soon as a method for
adding steps specific to each OS is added, then we can add that to the tool,
too.
