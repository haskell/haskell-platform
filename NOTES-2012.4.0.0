[] Versions issues:
    [] cgi - haven't heard from maintainer, anything newer than version in
        platform (3000.1.7.4) requires new packages
    [] html - haven't heard from maintainer, but no new versions exist
    [] GLUT & OpenGL - maintainer isn't sure that re-worked versions can
        be prepared in time

* Mac users with 10.7 or later and newer Xcode will probably have to install
  autoconf as it is no longer part of the command line tools

* Needed to down-rev to network-2.3.1.0 from network-2.4.0.1
  since cabal-install 0.14.0 had an upper bound on network < 2.4

* Needed to add primitive==0.5 to haskell-platform.cabal
  so the package will be included in the source tarball

* GHC includes these non-HP packages:
    bin-package-db-0.0.0.0/
    binary-0.5.1.0/
    ghc-prim-0.2.0.0/
    hoopl-3.8.7.3/
    integer-gmp-0.4.0.0/

* Still need the PatchSettings.hs program
