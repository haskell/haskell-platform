Release 2010.2.0.0

Changelog:

    * A crash when Haskell calls C, which in turn calls back into Haskell,
    has been fixed.
    * A bug which caused forking large processes to not terminate has been
    fixed.
    * Calling hSetEncoding will now set the encoding for both the read and
    write side of a Handle, rather than just the read side.
    * Using hReady and hWaitForInput on Handles created from Sockets will
    no longer block on Windows.
    * Some improvements have been made in when library functions do, and
    do not, block asynchronous exceptions.
    * bytestring: Fixed bug that caused hGetContents to block when it
    shouldn't.
    * A new flag -no-rtsopts flag allows you to disable parsing of +RTS
     ... options by the run-time system.  In some use-cases, when a
     program can be run as another user, this can cause security
     problems. For example, myprog -tsomefile will overwrite somefile if
     the other user has permissions to do so.
    * ghc-pkg now ensures that the conf files it writes are UTF8.
    * TH: A bug in the kind parser has been fixed.
    * directory: System.Directory.doesFileExist on Unix-like OSes now
     correctly identifies various types of special file as files.
