THE NEW HP BUILD

A single tool that can:
    - check the proposed set of packages
    - build the source tar ball (see below for definition)
        - given either the current tool chain
        - or the proposed one (should really be just cabal, yes?)
    - build directly from the source packages
        - using the current tool chain
        - checking that it is what we expect (optionally ignorable)
        - check if they are already installed
            - either force / update / skip if they are
    - install from source packages
        - build (see above)
        - if built, install
    - build the Mac installer
        - from the source packages (perhaps fetching if needed!)
        - from a bindist of ghc (perhaps fetching if asked)
        - checking that the bin dist is what we expect (optinoally ignorable)
    - rebuild master haddock


building a package
------------------
    - cd to the package source dir
    - ghc Setup
    - Setup configure w/million options
    - Setup build
    - Setup register --inplace
    - Setup haddock

installing a package
--------------------
    - cd to the package source dir
    - Setup copy (package puts it in rootdir)
    - Setup register (package registers in confdir)
    - ghc-pkg update the conf (install only)


the source package
------------------
    haskell-plaform-{version}/
        packages/
            xxxx-a.b.c.d            -- directory of unpacked source per package
            haskell-platform-a.b.c.d
                haskell-platform.cabal
                Setup.hs            -- not sure if we need this
                LICENSE
        hptool/
            the tool (in source form)
        etc/
            core.packages       -- packages in the core
            source.packages     -- packages added by the platform
            build.packages      -- packages in the platform, in build order


tree layouts

TO DO
=====

[ ] missing bits for target
    [ ] scripts needed at install time
        [ ] registration
        [ ] bin link up
        [ ] make this something that HP can use to set up the particular HP as the default

    [ ] haddock master files


[ ] what to do about Haddock? it is just a tool (not a lib), but it
    depends on a package, ghc-paths, which isn't part of the platform.
    [ ] furthermore, that package encodes build paths into the exec!!!!
    [ ] should we instead be using haddock from the ghc-bin-dist?

[ ] change how IncludeType encodes GHC-ness:
    IncGhc & IncGhcLib ---> IncGhc IncludeType
    - this way, we can include tools from GHC

[ ] mac polish
    [ ] bin in /Library/Haskell/<ver>/bin
    [ ] cabal.wrap
    [ ] UninstallHS.hs (incorporate into hp-tool?)
    [ ] /Library/Haskell/current/* sym links (include in patch script?)
    [ ] final call out to PackageMaker
        [ ] templatize those control files?

[ ] either don't untar the ghc bindist twice
    or use resources to ensure that we don't ghcInstall in parallel
    or use the new wrapper & new pkg-db technique from the old mac build

-=-


[ ] haskell-platform itself is missing from build.packages
    [ ] does it need to be there? really?
    [ ] does it need to be built?

[ ] should the platfrom be taking the following from the GHC dist:
    registered in pkg db, not part of platfrom, but could be?
        - binary-0.7.1.0
        - ghc-7.8.x
        - ghc-prim-0.3.1.0
        - hoopl-3.10.0.0
    registered in pkg db, but shouldn't be part of the platform:
        - bin-package-db-0.0.0.0
        - integer-gmp-0.5.1.0
        - rts-1.0
    not registered in pkg db or part of platfrom, but shipped
        - haskeline-0.7.1.2
        - terminfo-0.4.0.0
        - xhtml-3000.2.1
    shiped with ghc
        - haddock

[ ] does generated haddock...
    [ ] correctly reference other modules?
    [ ] have hscolour'd source?

[ ] hscolour?
    [ ] check for presence
    [ ] include in platform?

[ ] invocation script
    [ ] support older host cabal w/o sandboxing
    [ ] exec hptool
    [ ] perhaps add an option to hptool to spec original name so errors
        read better

[ ] make build dir be current workding directory
    [ ] command line option for spec'ing where build dir is
    [ ] default location for build dir
    [ ] cd into build dir, and then eval all Rules / Actions from there

[ ] something is quite wrong with the marker system
    [ ] delete the dir, but not the marker - things don't always rebuild
    [ ] seems like sometimes things rebuild for no reason

[ ] still a few path bits hard coded here and there
    - see "../packages.conf.d" for example in Target.hs

[ ] fix inconsistency about if the cp destination is the dir,
    or the dir to hold the dir

[ ] hptool command to see if there are newer versions of packages (?)

[ ] several calls to head that should probably check and produce
    better error messages

[ ] ? split out ghc release info from HP, and just reference it?

[ ] fix oddness of targetDir being phoney

[ ] location of templates and hptool source for tarball are hardcoded
    -- see SourceTarball.hs: hptoolSourceDir & cabalTemplate



Shake Thoughts
--------------
[] building dirs needs better support
[] when you build something, you must build it afresh!
    [] and then never modify it
    [] these requirements come to light when building dirs
[] global Rules() make it hard to be modular
    [] if package A has rules for type foo
    and package B & C need foos, then both can't call the function
    in A that provides the rules

[] because need takes a list, and you only get parallelism if you
    supply all needs at once, it is hard to modularlize targets
    that are based on some hidden info

[] addPath isn't useful because command and friends use createProcess
    which looks up the executable in the current environment, not the
    modified environment that will be accompany the final execution

[] copyFile' should putNormal?

[] staunch seems to give up early?


[] would love a command line option: just print the known targets and oracles
[] would love an command line option that prints an explaination for each thing

[] would be nice if there was
    knowsHow :: FilePath -> Rule Bool
