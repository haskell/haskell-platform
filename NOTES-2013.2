NOTES-2013.2


[] need to inform folks that I'm going to publish a database with their e-mail
[] need a way to collect release notes
[] what do we do about API changes? Should the HP have multiple versions of a
    package? like when syb goes from 0.3.7 to 0.4.0 - that's an API change
[] automated collection of package info? google form? web site?
[] tests?!?!?!?!!!!

[] library maintainer responsibilities?
    - subscribe to haskell-platform@ or do we need a new address
    - version number hygene
    - working e-mail contact, provision for leaves
    - release notes
    - don't break the API
    - don't change the API needlessly
    - commitment to stability
    - build no warnings... please?

BUILD

[] support for build from dist-build
    [x] make file doesn't unpack without explicit target
    [] should move dist build package building code into makefile(?)

[x] something left a file named '*.conf' in the package.conf.d
    which broke the source step - removing it got us a little closer
    - didn't happen on rebuild, so not investigated

[] craziness with GHC_PACKAGE_PATH in build.sh

[x] why did platform.packages have extensible-exceptions-0.1.1.4?
    ==> because cgi-3001.1.7.4. required it!


[x] needed to add to the Makefile
    export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 10.7

[x] still have the bug that cabal update does it twice the first time
    - fixed!

[x] cabal doc is missing
    [x] run the following (requires pandoc on PATH)
    $ git clone --depth 5 --branch Cabal-v1.16.0 \
            git://github.com/haskell/cabal.git cabal-1.16.0
    $ cd cabal-1.16.0/Cabal
    $ make users-guide
    [x] result is in dist/doc/users-guide
    [x] copy this as dist-<arch>/root/Library/Framekworks/GHC.framework/Versions/<ver>/usr/share/doc/ghc/html/Cabal

[x] Three packages didn't manage to build docs:
    random, primitive, network

    They all fail like this:

    Data/Primitive/MachDeps.hs:15:0:
         error: MachDeps.h: No such file or directory
    Generating the primitive-0.5.0.1 package documentation failed

    dist/build/Network/BSD.hs:23:0:
         error: Typeable.h: No such file or directory
    Generating the network-2.4.1.2 package documentation failed

    [x] hand building them worked... so not sure what is going on:
        BASE=/Users/markl/Projects/A/platform/hp-github/src/macos/dist-i386
        cd $BASE/source/packages
        for d in *
        do test -f $d/dist/doc/html/${d%-*}/index.html || echo $d has no html doc
        done
        cd <pkg-dir>
        GHC_PACKAGE_PATH=$BASE/package.conf.d PATH="$BASE/bin:$PATH" \
            ./Setup haddock -v3 --hyperlink-source
    [x] reubuilt doc index and installer




= Site =

[x] Edit info in upper-right of index.html
[x] Update release schedule for current and next release on wiki:
   http://trac.haskell.org/haskell-platform/wiki/ReleaseTimetable
[x] add a new section to prior.markdown for previously current release
  [x] move the download links there
[x] on lambda.haskell.org
  [x] create /var/www/platform/download/<version>
  [x] copy installers there
  [x] create md5sum.txt:
    md5sum [hH]* > md5sum.txt
[x] update windows.markdown, mac.markdown, and linux.markdown
  [x] update the download link
  [x] update the number of the release
  [x] for linux, update the link to GHC binary download page
[x] update the GHC version and info on contents.markdown
[] make the doc
  [x] install the platform on a machine
  [x] cd /Library/Haskell/doc
  [x] tar czvLf ~/hp-doc-<ver>.tgz *
  [x] untar that somewhere and clean it up:
    [x] find packages -name 'bin' -o -name 'lib' | xargs rm -rf
    [x] remove mac stuff from start.html
    [x] retar it back up
  [x] get that tarball onto lambda
[] update current links on lambda:
  [] /var/www/platform/docs/current
  [] /var/www/platform/download/current

== November release: 20134.0.0 ==

[] error while running make build:
    Expected Cabal as a preinstalled package
    -- this is from build.sh
    -- commented out the check for now - but this needs to be reconciled with
    -- having two Cabal packages in the platform

[] have to remember to manually clean up the dist dirs if re-using them
  [] mac Makefile should have a better clean routine

[] GHC_PACKAGE_PATH can't be used in the cabal call to prepare.sh
  -- cabal: Use of GHC's environment variable GHC_PACKAGE_PATH is incompatible
     with Cabal. Use the flag --package-db to specify a package database (it can
    be used multiple times).

[] aeson requires dlist

[] the prepare.sh script should really be a haskell program, and could do with
  much better diagnostics - like checking of the set of packages is consistent
