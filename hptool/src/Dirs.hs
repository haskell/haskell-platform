-- | Define a directory pattern rule.

-- function is passed the directory, which will be empty, and should build it
-- afresh. Since a directory can't be a dependency in Shake, a marker file is
-- built with a directory list of the directory. In order to depend on a
-- directory built with this rule, use 'needDir'

-- specifications (absolute and relative).

-- the actual directory isn't known. The underlying target will be a marker
-- marker file.
--
-- If the action returns Just dir, the files under that dir will be made
-- dependencies of this target.
