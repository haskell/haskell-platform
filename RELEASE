= Process =

 [] Start a NOTES file for the release
  [] archive changelog.markdown to changelog-xxxx.markdown
  [] reset changelog.markdown for new versions

 [] Update package versions
     * Libraries shipped with GHC.
        http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Libraries_released_with_GHC
        -or-
        from an expanded GHC source package
          find . -name tests -prune -type f -o  -name '*.cabal'
            | xargs grep -i version: | grep -v -i cabal-version

        [] update haskell-platform.cabal
        [] update src/gneric/tarball/packages/core.packages

     * External libraries to latest stable version
        * set up to build macos, and run
            make rewrap
        * copy over haskell-platform.cabal to an empty directory
        * remove all the version constraints on non-GHC packages
        * uncomment all the version constraints on the GHC packages
        * set as appropriate:
            DIST=../hp-github/src/macos/dist-i386
        * run
            PATH=$DIST/bin:$PATH cabal instal \
                --only-dependencies --upgrade-dependencies\
                --package-db=$DIST/package.conf.d --dry-run
        * this will solve for a consistent set of versions!

        [] update haskell-platform.cabal

 * check and follow up on changes to visible packages.
 * check unix package builds
    * tarball/packages/core.packages has to be updated from .cabal file
    * update configure.ac with version number
    * update required GHC version
 * bump version number in .cabal file
 # put up .cabal file

 # check clean room builds
 # check windows installer
 # check mac installer

 - update content on lambda.galois.com
 # push web page with new urls.
 # publish reddit links with CDN.

 * in the future
   * the .cabal file should spec the GHC packages (rather than commented out)
     but these should be under a "manual" flag to allow use with non-HP GHC's
